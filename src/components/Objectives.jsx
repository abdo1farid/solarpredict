                Our goal is to improve urban quality of life by offering a smart relaxation space that reduces maintenance costs while enhancing visitor comfort and experience. It provides users with a public area for meetings, rest, and access to technology. The space also encourages education and awareness through digital tools, making the garden a pedagogical place. Designed as a green lung for the region, it focuses on intelligent water management and biodiversity improvement, reducing urban pollution. Maintenance of green spaces is digitized, and green technologies are integrated to promote sustainability. Overall, the project aims to foster social connections within the community.
